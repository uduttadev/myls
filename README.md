# myls: Recreation of ls

This is my attempt at a recreation of the very basics of the ls command. To download the repo and place it in a location of your choosing then edit your bashrc file with the following

```bash
export PATH="SHOME{PATH_TO_DIRECTORY}:$PATH"
```
Then run the program in any directory with:
```
myls
```
